# Boeing737_PowerSystem_in_Modelica
This repository contains a Boeing 737 Power System Model, as implemented in Modelica. The aircraft's distribution system has been fully implemented utilizing Modelica's object orientation, allowing easy replaceability of componenents. The system, that can be noted below, has all its components as replaceable (sunken boxes) that can be easily swapped with existing components in the library or ones that can be implemented using the existing base classes.
